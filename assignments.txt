There are two simple assignments that you will need to complete:

1. Create a single script that will click each menu item on the O.C. Tanner site and validate that you land on the approperate page.

2. Create a script that does a google search for Muramasa.  Finds the wikipedia result and clicks it. Then from the wikipida page capture his birthdate into a variable and print Muramasa's birthday to the console.

*Make sure to complete these assignments in thier own branch and push the branch up to origin when completed, or if not completed before the deadline given.
